    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Build algo724 backend
        run: docker-compose -f /home/user/algo724/algo724_backend/compose.yml up -d --force-recreate --build

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
